# The hack assembler written in python3 

<img src="http://techworm.page/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/download-17.png">


This architechture is inspired from Nand2Tetris course . Implemented in python3  
<p>
Well i think that this assembler could be much shorter in python code but I decided to go with  this architechture which divide the assembler functionalities into classes  making the it's easier to debug and for other people to see the logic behind each class .
